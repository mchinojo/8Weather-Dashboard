# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is about building a weather dashboard using the API of [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to to integrate dynamic real-time, and forecasted weather data of cities in the world.

I was given initial HTML, so I will be working mostly on the Javascript code. This app shall comply with the following requirements:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name.
    * The date.
    * An icon representation of weather conditions.
    * The temperature.
    * The humidity.
    * The wind speed.
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date.
    * An icon representation of weather conditions.
    * The temperature.
    * The humidity.
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

  I am using the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Also this app is powered by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://mchinojo.github.io/8Weather-Dashboard/
